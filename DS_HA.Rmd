## In this assignment we will do exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing on covid19 dataset that we have got.
### In this dataset there are 20 variables with all the variables indicating some kind of trend in COVID cases.

## Variable Description
### Legend : FIPS - Federal Information Processing Series
* Date as of : Date when the data was added in dataset
* Start week: Start data of survey
* End week: End data of survey
* State: State of subject
* County: County of subject
* Urban rural code: Rural-Urban Continuum Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan (metro) counties by the population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area or areas
* FIPS State: FIPS state codes were numeric and two-letter alphabetic codes defined in U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard Publication ("FIPS PUB") 5-2 to identify U.S. states and certain other associated areas. ... The codes are used in Geographic Names Information System, overseen by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.
* FIPS County: The Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 6-4 (FIPS 6-4) is a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code which uniquely identified counties and county equivalents in the United States, certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states.
* FIPS Code: FIPS codes are numbers which uniquely identify geographic areas. The number of digits in FIPS codes vary depending on the level of geography
* Indicator: There are three survey patterns that are conducted for constructing this dataset on each county : Distribution of all-cause deaths (%), Distribution of COVID-19 deaths (%), Distribution of population (%)
* Total Deaths: Total deaths in the span of the survey
* COVID-19 Deaths: Deaths due to COVID-19
* Non-Hispanic White: Non-Hispanic whites are European Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, and North African Americans as defined by the United States Census Bureau. 
* Non-Hispanic Black: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa
* Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native: The term 'Alaska Native' are used in place of the word 'Indian' to include all indigenous people in Alaska.
* Non-Hispanic Asian:A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian Subcontinent.
* Other: Groups not identified by any category
* Hispanic: A Spanish-speaking person, especially one of Latin American descent, living in the US.
* Urban Rural Description: The type and scale of urbanization of an area e.g. metro, small metro, etc.
* Footnote: An additional piece of information printed at the bottom of a page.

## Survey Description
### The survey conducted for building the dataset was done to infer the following:
* To show the trend of COVID-19 increase with time
* To monitor which counties have more spread of infection and which have less so as to prioritize the resources and medical response
* To establish a relation between urban/rural areas and COVID-19 infection
* To observe which groups of people among the vast variety of human population catches the infection more and why

## Metadata

The dataset was provided by teacher

1. Urban-Rural Description : For this variable there are no units as it is categorical data, for hypothesis testing we used mean/median. 
2. COVID-19 Deaths: It is numerical data without units, for hypothesis testing we used mean/median.
3. Distribution of all-cause death(%): Unit here is percentage 
4. Distribution of Covid-19 death(%): Unit here is percentage

## What we are doing 
### We are going to setup a hypothesis test between urban rural description and covid-19 deaths variables; also we will see if there is any relationship between ‘Distribution of all-cause death(%)' and ‘Distribution of Covid-19 death(%)

* Part 1 - Hypothesis Testing
## Setting up hypotheses

## H₀ Null Hypothesis
### The null hypothesis is that urban rural description has no effect on covid-19 deaths



## Hₐ Alternate Hypothesis
### The alternate hypothesis is that urban rural description has a profound impact on covid-19 deaths where more urban counties mostly will have higher number of COVID-19 related deaths 

## R Code for hypothesis testing

```{r}

#Read Csv file
hp <- read.csv("covid.csv")
head(hp)
```

```{r}

urd <- hp$urd
c19d <- hp$c19d

df <- data.frame(urd,c19d)

head(df)

```

## Conclusions:
